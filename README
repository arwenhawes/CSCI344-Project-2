Build an application that tracks some data about a user-specified search term on Twitter. Here are the minimal specs:

(1) Your app should use cTwitter to connect to the Twitter API.

(2) Your app should use a text field to get some information from the user (for example, a search term).


(3) You'll obviously need to use variables to store some kind of running information on the data.

(4) You'll need to use at least one jQuery plugin (not twitter-related) -- it doesn't matter which one or how you use it, but you'll need to find one.

(5) You'll need to use Google WebFonts in some way

(6) Your code should pass HTML Lint and JSLint with all options turned on.

I am building a web app that uses twitter to play a game similar to Google whack. The user enters are term and the app uses Ctwitter to track how often
that term is tweeted. If the user gets a single hit, I will use the avgrund plug for a pop up box to state the user is a winner.
I am also using fittext plug in to stretch the heading further across the web page.

I finally feel like I have a handle on jquery. This was  a good (although sometimes painful) project to learn it on.
